        The rapid development and deployment of Large-Language Models (LLMs) has led to
growing interest in leveraging ontologies and knowledge graphs to enhance LLM
capabilities and address limitations. Combining the semantically rich architectures
provided by ontologies and knowledge graphs with the generative strengths of LLMs
promises to provide a path towards more explainable artificial intelligence systems,
more trustworthy output, and a deeper understanding of vulnerabilities arising from
integrated architectures. This workshop, associated with a special issue of Applied
Ontology, is dedicated to exploring the convergence of knowledge representation and
LLM strategies, design patterns, models, and benchmarks. We aim to bring together
researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts from industry, academia, and government in
the interest of exploring possible convergence points and advancing each field.
